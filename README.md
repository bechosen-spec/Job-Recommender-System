### Job Recommender System

### Project Description

The Job Recommender System is an intelligent tool designed to assist job seekers in finding relevant job opportunities based on their interests and job preferences. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and content-based filtering techniques to recommend jobs that closely match a given job title or description.

### Key Features

- TF-IDF Vectorization: Utilizes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to transform job descriptions into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of words in the context of the entire job dataset.
- Cosine Similarity: Computes the cosine similarity between job descriptions to identify jobs that are most similar to the given input, providing personalized recommendations.
- Web-based Interface: Offers a user-friendly web-based interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the recommender system seamlessly.
- Scalable: Designed to handle large job datasets efficiently, making it suitable for various job markets and industries.
